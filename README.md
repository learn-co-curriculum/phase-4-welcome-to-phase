# Welcome to Phase 4

## Learning Goals

- Understand how this phase is structured
- Learn the outcomes of this phase

## Intro to Phase 4

Welcome to Phase 4! At this point in the program, you've tackled two programming
languages, JavaScript and Ruby, as well as mastering a frontend framework,
React. Throughout our journey, we've focused on a specific kind of application
architecture: creating a **single-page application** that consumes JSON data from a
**Web API**.

In this phase, we're going to focus on creating our very own **Web API** server
using an incredibly powerful tool, Ruby on Rails (or, as the cool kids say, just
Rails). By building an API to serve JSON data in Rails, you'll have full control
over the backend logic: from how **requests** are handled and how the
**response** is generated, to how your **models** interact with the database
using Active Record. By the end of this phase, you can truly claim your mantle
as a full-stack developer!

## Phase 4 Structure

This phase is structured to start small, and gradually build in complexity.
We'll start by learning:

- How to **handle a request** in Rails and send **JSON as a response**
- How **Rails conventions** help organize our code
- How to perform **CRUD** operations in Rails

Then, we'll add in some additional complexity:

- How to work with **multiple models and relationships**
- How to **validate user data** to keep our database clean
- How to **format our JSON response** to make it easy to work with

Finally, we'll learn how to handle **user authentication** across multiple
requests.

## Phase 4 Objectives

By the end of this phase, you should be able to:

- Create and configure backend servers
- Implement the model-view-controller design pattern in a Rails application
- Recognize RESTful conventions in a Rails application
- Create, read, update and delete data in a Rails application
- Incorporate user authentication into an application
- Design, create and publish a full-stack, database-backed Rails application

We've got an exciting time ahead, so let's get started!
