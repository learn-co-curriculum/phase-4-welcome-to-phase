# Welcome to Phase 4

## Learning Goals

- Understand how this phase is structured
- Learn the outcomes of this phase

## Intro to Phase 4

Welcome to Phase 4! At this point in the program, you've tackled two programming
languages, JavaScript and Ruby, as well as mastering a frontend framework,
React. Throughout our journey, we've focused on a specific kind of application
architecture: creating a **single-page application** that consumes JSON data from a
**Web API**.

In this phase, we're going to focus on creating our very own **Web API** server
using an incredibly powerful tool, Ruby on Rails (or, as the cool kids say, just
Rails). By building an API to serve JSON data in Rails, you'll have full control
over the backend logic: from how **requests** are handled and how the
**response** is generated, to how your **models** interact with the database
using Active Record. By the end of this phase, you can truly claim your mantle
as a full-stack developer!

## Phase 4 Structure

This phase is structured to start small, and gradually build in complexity. Each
module of content (a section of labs and readmes) ends with a quiz or "putting
it all together" lab where you can check your understanding of the material. Here's
what each module covers:

### Rails Fundamentals

Learn how to use Rails as a backend framework to create a server, and how
following conventions helps keep our code organized and efficient. You'll also
see the full request-response cycle and how data flows through a Rails
application.

### CRUD with Rails

Use Rails to build a RESTful API that can perform common CRUD operations with a
database, and how to access all the data being sent to our Rails app as well as
how to properly format a response with a JSON body and HTTP status codes.

### Validations

Validations help keep our database clean, and prevent unwanted data from
sneaking in. Learn how to use Active Model to add simple validations to your
model, and how to respond to invalid data from users.

### Client-Server Communication

As full stack developers, it's always important to consider the frontend and
the backend as you're building applications. Get a better understanding of
how client-server communication happens via the request-response cycle, and
how to debug common errors.

### Active Record Associations

Building more complex applications requires a larger domain made up of several
related models. Learn how to use Active Record in Rails to create associations
between models, and how to follow RESTful conventions with multiple related
models.

### Serialization

When designing web APIs, one important consideration is how our data is sent
back to our users. Learn how to use a serializer to shape how your JSON data is
structured in the response.

### Auth

Authentication and authorization are two important topics in designing web
applications. Learn how to use cookies to help identify users across multiple
requests, and authorize users for access to specific actions on the server once
they've logged in.

### Deploying

So far, we've been building applications locally &mdash; but the end goal
is to be able to deploy our projects to the web, so that anyone can view
them! In this section, we'll discuss what the deployment process looks like
and how to deploy a React/Rails API application to a server.

## Phase 4 Objectives

By the end of this phase, you should be able to:

- Create RESTful APIs
- Validate data
- Share data between a frontend JavaScript application and a backend API
  application
- Build authentication into APIs
- Deploy backend applications

We've got an exciting time ahead, so let's get started!
